# Daily Reflections Plugin for Logseq - Typescript (based on Creighton University's Daily Reflections)

This is a simple logseq plugin that inserts an iframe from the Daily Reflections @ Creighton University that corresponds with the day's Journal page.

It then creates a subsequent block after the iframe to insert personal reflections.

Big thanks to Creighton Jesuit University and the USCCB, without whom this plugin would not be possible.
